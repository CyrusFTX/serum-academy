## Serum Ecosystem

The nodes recently voted in favor of the following proposition, creating an initiative to fund projects building on Serum coordinated by [EcoSerum](https://www.ecoserum.dev), one of Project Serum's nodes. Furthermore, 2% of all Serum fees will be used to fund new projects through [EcoSerum](https://www.ecoserum.dev).

### Funding and Tokens

If you’re building a new project on Serum, you can coordinate with EcoSerum on the following terms:

- EcoSerum will have grants available for promising proposals. This will be funded primarily with 2% of all Serum fees. To kick start things, the EcoSerum Project Funding Pool (EPFP) has been seeded with 200,000 locked SRM tokens and 1 locked MegaSerum (MSRM).

  - These are (M)SRM tokens that are fully locked until 2021-08-01 and then unlock linearly over the following 6 years.

- Any promising project will be eligible for a grant of between 1,000 and 20,000 unlocked SRM tokens to pre-launch.

- Each project that receives a grant will get a further grant of SRM upon project launch. EcoSerum will decide on the second grant size post-launch depending on the project’s execution, ranging from 5,000 SRM to 100,000 SRM, locked 1-7 years.

- For some projects general to Solana, there may be an additional 25 SOL granted for every 100 SRM.

- Each project that receives a grant and successfully launches will also have a 1% chance of winning the MegaSerum!

- Each project can choose to implement a fee/revenue model that is integrated into Project Serum. If they do:

  - The Serum nodes will help in managing the project and its revenue
  - There will be an SPL token minted for the project; call it TA.
  - 100% of the revenue/fees/etc. of the project will go to a weekly buy/burn of TA.
  - The project team will be granted 20% of TA tokens; 1% unlocked, 19% with a 1-7 year lock.
  - In the case of a massive/complicated project and/or which does not come from the community’s blueprint, these terms are negotiable with EcoSerum.
  - 1% of TA will be distributed to EcoSerum stakers, pro-rata, 1-7 year lock.
  - The other 79% of TA tokens will be distributed pro-rata to all SRM tokens staked (any SRM can be staked, whether locked or unlocked, and there is no minimum quantity). Unlocked SRM holders will receive unlocked TA; locked SRM holders will receive 1-7 year locked TA. Rather than giving one grant up-front, the locked TA will be distributed over the next 7 years to locked SRM.
  - The nodes will manage the entire process, integrating it into the SRM [buy/burns](https://projectserum.com/srm-faq) and [staking](https://projectserum.com/staking-voting).
  - The nodes will coordinate to help TA get listed on Serum with an IDO (initial dex offering) and supported by major Serum GUIs.
  - The nodes will coordinate to get liquidity providers to support TA markets.
  - The nodes will support it with standard [node duties](https://projectserum.com/staking-voting), including cranking, cross-chain support, and more
